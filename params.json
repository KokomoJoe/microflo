It is inspired by and designed for integration with [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/), a JavaScript-based FBP system.\r\n\r\nYou can program with MicroFlo either:\r\n* Visually, using the [NoFlo UI](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui)\r\n* Textually, using the declarative [.fbp DSL](http://noflojs.org/documentation/fbp)\r\nor [.json definition](http://noflojs.org/documentation/json) specced by NoFlo\r\n* Programatically, by embedding it and building a graph using the C++ API\r\n\r\nGet started with MicroFlo for Arduino\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n[Tutorial](https://github.com/jonnor/microflo/blob/master/doc/arduino-getstarted.md)","google":"UA-45990246-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
