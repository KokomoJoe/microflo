Status

Stand proposal submitted.

Goals
------
* Introduce MicroFlo and visual Arduino programming to the public maker audience
* Gather feedback. How understandable, useful is it. What would people like to use it for

Setup
-----
Have a couple of machines running Linux and the NoFlo IDE, hooked up
to Arduino boards with some pheripials. Have some ready made examples, and
then invite people to play around with re-programming.

Have a list where people can sign up to be notified about future workshops (at Bitraf).
Could have a small competition or raffle for people signing up.

Ideas
