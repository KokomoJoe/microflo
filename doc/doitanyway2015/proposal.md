* Status: Invited

Workshop: Sonification & the Physical
-----------------------------------

We will use visual programming in Flowhub to create
custom sensors, interactions and sound experiences.

As a basis we have microcontrollers (Arduino) wired
with sensors, both off-the-shelf and custom-built.
These we will connect to our laptops and/or
embedded Linux machines (Raspberry Pi) and use
SuperCollider to create sound from these.

Depending on the interest and feedback,
we may go on to develop an installation or performance
to be completed during the festival.

Participants should bring:

* Laptop (Linux/OSX/Windows)
* Headphones

Links:

* [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/)
* [Flowhub](http://flowhub.io)
* [sndflo](https://github.com/jonnor/sndflo)
* [MicroFlo](http://microflo.org/)


Rider
--------

Needed from venue.

* A set of speakers

Basic electronics lab equipment

* 2x soldering irons
* Multimeter
* Standard set of E12 resistor values
* Standard range of capacitors


Will bring

* Microcontrollers (Arduino / ESP8266), up to 10
* Embedded Linux devices (Raspberry Pi / BeagleBone)
* Selection of sensors. Light, distance, proximity, vibration

Bio
----
Jon Nordby is a creative software and electronics engineer who
specializes in open source, Linux and Embedded Systems.
Previously he has contributed to various libre graphics projects,
including MyPaint, GIMP and OpenRaster.
Since early 2014 Jon works for The Grid, developing the Flowhub
visual programming IDE and runtimes for microcontrollers (MicroFlo),
image processing (imgflo) and sound synthesis (sndflo).
For the last year he is also an active member of the Bitraf makerspace in Oslo,
researching and developing digital fabrication methods including 3d-printing.


Notes
------

* Minimize time used on setup and tech foo
* Move as quickly as possible over to concept exploration and development
* Allow participants to develop/play around independently
    * Use their laptops + headphones
* Enourage working on joint concept after exploration phase
    * Connected devices
