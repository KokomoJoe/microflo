* [Do It Anyway](http://www.opensourcingfestivals.eu/events/do-it-anyway-festival-sheffield-uk)
* 15-16 May at Access Space in Sheffield, UK
* Status: Invited

Presentation:
---------------

Themes:


Show series of pictures of objects.
From mundane to complex

* Wristwatch
* Airplane
* Fridge
* Car
* Nuclear power plant
* Lamp

Ask

* 
* Hint: picture of computer
* Answer: they all run software (intrinsic development)
* Furthermore, new developments/innovations often driven by SW
* Point: You cannot see or change (non-intrinsic development)

About:

* Engineer
* Don't self-identify as an artist

Presentation:

* Exploration
* Questioning existing ways of doing
* Implied critisism


Programming today

* Text-based
* Imperative. Hardvard architecture
* Instruction-based
* Code (compile/interpret) -> program (run)
* Tools for creating/changing/ not present in program
* Each step is lossy, hard/impossible to regain information going back
* Mental model not captured, stays only in head of programmer
* All state lost when making change, start over again
* If you did not catch bug in the act
* Non-interactive
* Indirect manipulation (ref Brett V. "bindly manipulating symbols")

Alternative

* Visual and text-based
* interactive
* data-based
* mental-model first, 
* reactive
* code<->program duality: Code is program, program is code

Paradigms

* dataflow, flow-based
* contracts
* finite automata
* decision trees
* graph databases
* programming-by-example

Investigations

* introspectable software
* introspectable systems (incl hardware). system models, interactive
* feedback loops
* man-machine symbiosis
* human-assisted computer processes
* computer-assisted human processes
* augmentation interfaces, no-limits

Projects

* Flowhub. fbp-protocol, heterogenous systems, 
* MicroFlo. dataflow, live prog, browser simulator
* live-url via NFC/QR code
* finito. finite automata, modelling statefulness, known-bounds testing
* agree. contracts, static dynamic analysis
* msgflo. multi-device/worker systems
* GCC laserpro drivers
* Shopbot control reversing.
* 3d-printed cutting tools. Designing for reproducability, local manufacturing
* Flexible 3dprint, Cura Voronoi

Ideas

* home integrated digital fabrication devices
* universality in fabrication, scaling horizontally
* high-tech, local/micro, sustainability

Introspection as a basis for smart systems

* ability for human to query, observe, progressively improved tools, reasoning
* feedback loops. Human-only, human-based






Workshop: Sonification & the Physical
-----------------------------------

We will use visual programming in Flowhub to create
custom sensors, interactions and sound experiences.

As a basis we have microcontrollers (Arduino) wired
with sensors, both off-the-shelf and custom-built.
These we will connect to our laptops and/or
embedded Linux machines (Raspberry Pi) and use
SuperCollider to create sound from these.

Depending on the interest and feedback,
we may go on to develop an installation or performance
to be completed during the festival.

Participants should bring:

* Laptop (Linux/OSX/Windows)
* Headphones

Links:

* [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/)
* [Flowhub](http://flowhub.io)
* [sndflo](https://github.com/jonnor/sndflo)
* [MicroFlo](http://microflo.org/)


Rider
--------

Needed from venue.

* A set of speakers

Basic electronics lab equipment

* 2x soldering irons
* Multimeter
* Standard set of E12 resistor values
* Standard range of capacitors


Will bring

* Microcontrollers (Arduino / ESP8266), up to 10
* Embedded Linux devices (Raspberry Pi / BeagleBone)
* Selection of sensors. Light, distance, proximity, vibration
* Some material for building own sensors. Bare Conductive, opamps
* Some external USB soundcards
* Some RCA,3.5mm,1/4" adaptors

Bio
----
Jon Nordby is a creative software and electronics engineer who
specializes in open source, Linux and Embedded Systems.
Previously he has contributed to various libre graphics projects,
including MyPaint, GIMP and OpenRaster.
Since early 2014 Jon works for The Grid, developing the Flowhub
visual programming IDE and runtimes for microcontrollers (MicroFlo),
image processing (imgflo) and sound synthesis (sndflo).
For the last year he is also an active member of the Bitraf makerspace in Oslo,
researching and developing digital fabrication methods including 3d-printing.


Notes
------

* Minimize time used on setup and tech foo
* Move as quickly as possible over to concept exploration and development
* Allow participants to develop/play around independently
    * Use their laptops + headphones
* Enourage working on joint concept after exploration phase
    * Connected devices
