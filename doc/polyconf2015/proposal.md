* Type: Workshop
* July 2-4, Poznan
* CfP: http://bit.ly/polyconf15-cfp
* Status: Proposed

Abstract
----------

Flowhub is a visual dataflow programming IDE
which supports any runtime which implements the FBP protocol.

Examples of existing runtimes include NoFlo (JavaScript) for Node.js and browser,
sndflo (SuperCollider) for audio synthesis, imgflo (C) for image processing,
and MicroFlo for microcontrollers/embedded (C++).

In the workshop we will build a polyglot, cross-runtime system,
and show how you can implement new runtimes for your favorite language and problem domain.


Outline
----------

* Intro to dataflow/FBP programming concepts
* Introduction to Flowhub, architecture and existing runtimes
* Hands-on building of a cross-runtime app
* Introduction to the FBP runtime protocol
* Hands-on, running examples of custom protocol implementation

Talk history
------------

Have not given this workshop before, but have presented on topics related to Flowhub a couple of times before. Videos available:

* Piksel 2013 - MicroFlo, visual programming for microcontrollers
* FOSDEM 2014 (IoT devroom) - Flow-based programming for heterogenous systems
* Open Hardware Summit 2014 - Death to Black Boxes

Have given a couple workshops on Flowhub/NoFlo/Microflo at (no videos available)

* Bitraf hackerspace, Oslo
* c-base hackerspace, Berlin
* Fablab conference, Barcelona

Bio
----
Jon builds Flowhub at The Grid - a visual dataflow IDE,
and uses it to create the image processing capabilities of their AI web publishing platform.
Previously he has done systems development in Embedded/Linux projects.
Loves enabling high-level programming in low-level problem domains.
