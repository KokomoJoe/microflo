Thoughts on best practices
======================

Components must have a single, well defined, task.
The input and output data (interface) must be minimal.
It is 'preferable' that the component has minimal internal state, and low internal complexity.
Design the component for black-box testing.

A programmer may chose to make one "fat" component in C++, or compose the same ''logical''
function as a graph of many small/"thin" MicroFlo components. The latter may result in larger reusability.
But if the straightforward solution is a fat component, maybe make that first, then decompose as an (optional)
second step. Reasons for this can include reuse/retrofitting existing code, flow-based thinking not familiar
or not easily applicable to the problem domain.
Conversely, if and when a graph of thin components does not perform well enough, combining into a supercomponent may
be a viable strategy.

User Interface
==============

Foundations
------------
Microprocessor programs are embedded software; they make little sense without the
accompaning hardware and the real-life environment on which they act.

How to avoid "blindly manipulating symbols"? [ref](http://vimeo.com/66085662)
Need direct manipulation, interactive parametrization.

How to go from telling the machine HOW to do things, to defining WHAT it does?

Ideas
-------

Realist

* Show serial console(s), allow to send data to uController
* Allow to subscribe to data flowing through connections, inspect
* Allow to change the graph, upload new config at runtime and persist a new config to device
* Visualize the state of the uController in/out ports/peripherals
* Allow to add mock HW components and attach to uController

Idealist

* Monitor the graph, recording the events by default - then be able to
go back in time and replay the events - maybe export to regression test?
* Visualizations for data flowing through graph and components. Interactive, custom
* Dynamic changes to graph while running
* Data breakpoints/conditionals and expressions
* Allow to parameterize behaviour, explore classes of systems, relationships
* Allow defining components/graphs/programs by "macro recording" and defining input-output relationships
* Let HW components be properly simulated electronics, allow to output schematics/layouts


Hardware targets
===================
ARM Cortex-M3/M4(F) most interesting. Dirty-cheap modules available from TI (Launchpad) and STM (Discovery)

Correctness, Testing
=====================
Can one generate/create some general tests for a component by describing/classifying the component?

Possible Classes, Invariants.

* I/O: has real-world side-effect / external state
* Pure: not stateful, without side-effects
* Syncronous: Sends message out as direct result of message in
* Generator: Creates messages on its own (without requiring input)
* 1-1: One message out for every message out
* Deterministic: Same sequence of inputs results in same sequence of outputs
* State-free: Same input message always results in same output message
* Real-time/bounded-time: A message in is guaranteed to have its corresponding output within a certain time

Are there formalisms which can be provably correct suited for components?

* Finite State Machine
* Truth tables
* Boolean algebra/logic
* Mathematical expression

Arduino, advancements and lacks
================================
Arduino is a massively succesfull project which has made it much easier
to program microcontrollers, both for hobbyists and professionals.

Advancements
* Microcontroller can be programmed without speciality HW programmer
* Development boards are cheap, and can be used directly in small-scale production
* User does not have to care about registers and interrupts
* Large open software ecosystem: libraries and example sketches
* Large open hardware ecosystems: boards,shields,peripherals
* Cross-platform, minimal IDE for starting out
* Easy to extend computer I/O and do programming there (Firmata)
* Breadboard diagrams for easy HW layout, compared to schematics+PCB (Fritzing)

Lacks
* User has to learn to read and write C/C++
* Few best practices for organizing and architecting non-trivial programs
* No device simulator or emulator widely available
* Very few practices around structured and automated testing
* Mostly focused on polling based syncronous code
* LGPL license, unclear if use in proprietary products OK
* No freely available IDE which does both hardware and software
* Purely textual programming, not making use of peoples visual capabilities
