MicroFlo: Visual programming for microcontrollers

When a sound artist wants to create new input devices or interaction, they often reach for their Arduino.
A popular set of tools is Firmata+PureData (or Max MSP), interacting with the microcontroller through visual dataflow programming. 
This requires a computer to run the custom program, and limits programs to what the Firmata firmware can do.
With MicroFlo one can visually program the microcontroller itself, allowing to make use of the small size, low-power, and real-time 
functionality of the microcontroller - opening up additional applications.
