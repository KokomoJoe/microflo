Death to Black Boxes: lets make introspectable devices
================

Abstract
-----------
Open hardware electronics devices often appear to the user much in the same way as proprietary devices;
as black-boxes with a given set of functionality.
Even making minor changes to the software of the device typically requires searching for the
right source code, setting up complex toolchains and learning to program in C/C++.

In the [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org), [MicroFlo](http://microflo.org) and [Finito](http://github.com/jonnor/finito)
open source projects we are creating programming models and tools to make electronics devices
that one can can connect to, introspect and visually re-program on the fly - using a standard browser or mobile app.

Why is this important?
-------------------------
Open hardware gives, through the licences of the hardware and software design files, certain rights:
The right to use the device for any purpose, study, improve and re-share.
The license does however not require this to be easy, and frequently it is not. 

To make open hardware devices *effectively open*, I belive we must actively work on
lowering the barriers to making use of these rights.
Through a talk and workshop I hope to raise awareness of this issue,
share the work I am doing in this area and inspire others to join in
