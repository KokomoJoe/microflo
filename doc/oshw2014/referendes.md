The reason our planet can bear over six billion people is embedded software. Because software is so ubiquitous and embedded in 
nearly everything we do, we need to stay in control. We must ensure that the systems and their software run as we intend—or better.

This trend toward embedded software in practically all systems is accelerating. The world market for embedded systems is 
approximately 160 billion euros, involving approximately 3 billion embedded units delivered per year and a compound annual growth of 
9 percent.– 1–3 Owing to the nature of embedded systems, most of these sales are on the hardware side; however, the relevance of 
software and services is rapidly increasing.

Too often, when speaking about software, we concentrate on IT systems; we think about general-purpose PCs, big IT systems, and 
online Internet applications. However, such IT systems incorporate less than 2 percent of the microprocessors produced.
