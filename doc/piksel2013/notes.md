Status
------
Proposal accepted

Goals
----------------
* Spark interest around visual programming models for microcontrollers
* Gather feedback from artists that have used Arduino etc: what do they find lacking

Storyarc
-----------
?

Outline
--------

Perspectives / Motivation
--------------------------
Software Engineer
* Correctness, testability
* Predictable, short development times
* Self-documenting, easy-to-understand systems


Hobbyist
* Fun, instant gratification
* Fast, but unbounded learning curve
* Exploratory learning and making


Philosophical/Ideological
* Technical systems encode assumptions about people/processes.

* Avoid possible new Digital Divide,
between those who can make, and those who can only use/consume
Production capacity used to be divided between those who have the financial means (capital) and those
who do not (often physical property like resources, soil, machinery). As we in the tech. industry
increasingly make capital less important, knowledge and "intellectual property" gains importance
* Attempt to improve end-user freedom for embedded devices
I want devices that *I* control, not devices that control me - and that everyone feels the same

Imperative, textual programming
----------------
"Code is blindly manipulating symbols" - Bret Victor
Assuming a Van Neumann-like architecture. Problems: Multi-core, DSP, FPGA, GPUs
Micro-managing the machine
Many programmers seem to fear not having this sort of control, possibly its a fear that the machine will have
Paradoxially, the machine does end up dictating us - 
because we've tailored our notational systems to how the machine works - not to how we as humans understand things


Different visual progamming models
-------------
* Sequence-diagrams
* Data-flow
* Finite state machines
* Ladder-based
* Imperative

Why does visual architecture and programming stop at the whiteboard?

We have UML... Problems: assumes waterfall, that design/modelling stage ends up in code,
never need to go back to modelling. Need to support iterative workflows, fast iterations
Tools also lived seperately from those used to implement the system, and often used by diffenent people

Prior art

Status
-------
What works, what can it be used for
Current limitations


Future
-----------
* Hetrogenous systems
* Distributed & collaborative programs
* "Internet of Things"
* Live-coding on microcontrollers???
